# Computational Methods & C++

The application of numerical schemes for the solution of partial differential equations using C++ Object Oriented language.

**The first order wave equation**

### What has been done?
C++ program solves the above problem on a uniform grid with the prescribed initial and boundary conditions using the following
methods:
• Explicit Upwind FTBS (Forward time, Backward space)
• Implicit Upwind FTBS (Forward time, Backward space)
• Lax-Wendroff
• Implicit FTCS (Forward time, Central space)
